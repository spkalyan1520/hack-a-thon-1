What can you build in 3 hours?

Getting Started
---------------

The source is located on Github and is publically accessible. To commit to the
repository you will need to be a member of the hackathon GitHub team. Simply
ask Taylor Everding to add your GitHub account to the team.

GitHub supports SVN and Git so use the tool of your choice for version control.
Different members of the team will recommended
[TortiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/), 
[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/),
[Git-Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/), and even the command line.

The urls are available for each method below.

    $ svn co https://github.com/Aquent-IT-Solutions/hack-a-thon-1
    $ git clone https://github.com/Aquent-IT-Solutions/hack-a-thon-1.git
    $ git clone git@github.com:Aquent-IT-Solutions/hack-a-thon-1.git

Until the backend team creates a file server, the front-end team can use
[`node-static`](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static) or
[`browser-sync`](http://www.browsersync.io/).

    $ npm install -g node-static
    $ static app
